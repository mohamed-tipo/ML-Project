In this notebook, we practice some of the classification algorithms.

Below, is where we are going to use the classification algorithms to create a model based on our training data and evaluate our testing data using evaluation metrics learned in the course.

We will use some of the algorithms :

Linear Regression
KNN
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
SVM
We will evaluate our models using:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error
R2-Score
Finally, will use your models to generate the report at the end.
